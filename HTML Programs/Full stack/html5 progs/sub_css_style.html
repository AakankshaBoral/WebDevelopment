			Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <span class="emp">Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</span> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<span class="emp"> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,</span> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
